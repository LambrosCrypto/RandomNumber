#RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR, powered by Nebulas Blockchain. 

We decided to build from scratch a DApp that generates a random number between 0 and a maximum. - Maximum is choosen by the user (maximum>0). We made a beautiful friendly user interface so that anyone can easily use our site. You, the user, will be guided on who to use our DApp - what this DApp actually does,  how to install the required $nas web-wallet extension and how to insert the data. We also added a filter to avoid users sending funds to the  DApp contract.

This DApp can be used for a wide variety of matters. From a bet with a friend , a teacher who wants to ask a random student to read out loud certain subject (it is way easier to type 50 rather than 50 names), a giveaway, etc.

We hope the $nas community enjoy it.
